This repository is a hosting ground for all annotated maps created for use with [UrdfSim](https://github.com/mitchellspryn/UrdfSim). UrdfSim allows arbitrary robots to be simulated inside of these high-quality environments. For more information about UrdfSim, [visit the github page](https://github.com/mitchellspryn/UrdfSim)!

In addition to serving as virtual environments for use with simulated robots, the locations of many obstacles, paths, and points of interest have been extracted into annotations, allowing them to be used in the design and training of machine learning algorithms. For more information on the types of annotations available, see the [documentation on annotations]()! To download the binaries, visit the [releases page](https://github.com/mitchellspryn/AnnotatedUnrealMaps/releases)!
